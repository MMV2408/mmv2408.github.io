My name is Mike, born on August 24, 2001, and I live in Middenbeemster. I am currently a first-year Electrical Engineering (BSc) student at the HvA (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences), and I really enjoy the program. 

This website is intended to showcase and track my progress as an electrical engineer. It serves as a personal portfolio and learning journal, where I document projects, experiments, and topics that interest me as I continue to develop my technical skills.

The site will be updated regularly as I learn new concepts and complete new projects. Feel free to explore and follow my journey. Enjoy!

<!--Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
